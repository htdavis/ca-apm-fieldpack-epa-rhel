# EPAgent Plugins for RHEL

# Description
The EPAgent Plug-ins for RHEL is a set of plug-ins for monitoring the Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system and application processes (specifically IBM WebSphere Application Server)

rhelDiskStats.pl - gathers I/O statistics for mount points.  
rhelSar.pl - gathers per CPU/core statistics.  
rhelVmStat.pl - gathers memory and some CPU statistics.  
psWASforLinux.pl - gathers usage statistics from WebSphere processes.  
rhelMpStat.pl - gathers per-processor statistics  

## Dependencies
Tested with CA APM 9.7.1/10.5.2 EM, EPAgent 9.7.1/10.5.2, RHEL 6.x/7.3, and Perl 5.16/5.22.

## Known Issues
There have been discussions about the reporting of CPU statistics when running on System z | z/Linux. We are currently looking into alternatives to getting this information for your use.

# Prerequisite
An installed and configured EPAgent.

# Install and Configure EPA Plug-ins for RHEL

1. Extract the plug-ins to \<*EPAgent_Home*\>/epaplugins.
2. Configure the IntroscopeEPAgent.properties file in \<*EPAgent_Home*\> by adding these stateless plug-in properties:

    introscope.epagent.plugins.stateless.names=DISKSTAT,SAR,PSWAS,VMSTAT,MPSTAT (can be appended to a previous entry)  
    introscope.epagent.stateless.DISKSTAT.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/rhel/rhelDiskStats.pl  
    introscope.epagent.stateless.DISKSTAT.delayInSeconds=900  
    introscope.epagent.stateless.PSWAS.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/rhel/psWASforLinux.pl  
    introscope.epagent.stateless.PSWAS.delayInSeconds=900  
    introscope.epagent.stateless.SAR.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/rhel/rhelSar.pl  
    introscope.epagent.stateless.SAR.delayInSeconds=900  
    introscope.epagent.stateless.VMSTAT.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/rhel/rhelVmStat.pl  
    introscope.epagent.stateless.VMSTAT.delayInSeconds=900  
    introscope.epagent.stateless.MPSTAT.command=perl <epa_home>/epaplugins/rhel/rhelMpStat.pl  
    introscope.epagent.stateless.MPSTAT.delayInSeconds=900

3. PSWAS requires that you know the tab location of the WAS application name in the 'ps' output. It is recommended that you speak with your WAS administrator about standardizing the location of that property to ensure consistent results. Adjust the value of '$psCommand' at line 19 of the program.

# Use EPAgent Plug-ins for RHEL
Start the EPAgent using the provided control script in \<*EPAgent_Home*\>/bin.

# Debug and Troubleshoot
Update the root logger in \<epa_home\>/IntroscopeEPAgent.properties from INFO to DEBUG, then save. No need to restart the JVM.
You can also manually execute the plugins from a console and use perl's built-in debugger.

# Limitations
There have been discussions about CPU statistics reporting when running on System z | z/Linux. We are monitoring this situation to provide you with information as it becomes available.
